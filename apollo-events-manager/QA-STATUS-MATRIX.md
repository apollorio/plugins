|----------|--------|-------|
| High-severity issues | ✅ Clean | No unescaped output, no unsanitized input |
| Medium-severity issues | ⚠️ Some remain | Style-only, deferred |

## GO/NO-GO Checklist

### GO Criteria (All must be ✅)

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| No known XSS vulnerabilities | ✅ |
| No known SQL injection vulnerabilities | ✅ |
| All AJAX handlers verify nonce | ✅ |
| All inputs sanitized | ✅ |
| All outputs escaped | ✅ |
| PHP 8.3 compatible | ✅ |
| Core MVP flows functional | ✅ |
| Security audit complete | ✅ |

### NO-GO Criteria (Any blocks release)

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Critical security vulnerability | ❌ None found |
| Data loss risk | ❌ None found |
| PHP fatal errors | ❌ None found |
| Breaking changes to public API | ❌ None |

---

## Recommendation

**Status: ✅ GO FOR MVP RELEASE**

The plugin has passed security audit (Phase 3) and PHP 8.3 compatibility checks (Phase 4). All MVP flows are functional with proper input sanitization and output escaping. Test coverage is minimal but skeleton tests exist for future expansion.

### Post-MVP Priorities

1. Increase test coverage to 40%+
2. Implement rate limiting for telemetry endpoints
3. Review and tighten permission callbacks
4. Complete PHPCS cleanup (medium-severity)
5. Audit legacy modules in `modules/rest-api/`
